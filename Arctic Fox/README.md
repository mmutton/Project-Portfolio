## ARCTIC

## Description:
  
This is a small educational site.

Dropdown menu contains links to resourses regarding life in the Arctic region. These include a conservation site, the image sharing site Unsplash.com, for a look at additional arctic images, and finally NASA's take on climate change.

This project was created just for fun, but includes some interesting content, pretty pictures, and a cool "why" button.
